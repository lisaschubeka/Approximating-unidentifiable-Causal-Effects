         In particular, each tuple (a path) will have two entries: the first one is a list with the path for 
         the original model, and the second one the path for the canonical model. In other words, the original 
         expression and the translated version.
        
         In the first list, the parameters are represented also as lists with two entries: first is the name of the variable and second is the value
         In the second list, you have the list of principal strata/response variables.
          
         The algorithm for translation is a BFS one.
         It starts with all the root ancestors ( layer 1 ).
         
         The number of canonical parameters of the root ancestor
         is identical to the number of values their variable can assume

         For every descendent variable (layers - 2, 3, ...), the parameters 
          will depend to the value of their parents in the original model
        
         Consider this example: Let the model Z -> X, Z -> Y, X -> Y,
         This model has only root Z, with two values: Z0 and Z1
        
         Now consider X, if X = 0, you have to consider two cases:
         a) If Z = 1, then X will include the canonical parameters X00 (X[Z=0]=0,X[Z=1]=0) and X10 (X[Z=0]=1,X[Z=1]=0),
         b) If Z = 0, then X will include the canonical parameters X00 (X[Z=0]=0,X[Z=1]=0) and X01 (X[Z=0]=0,X[Z=1]=1),
         
         For considering cases of Y, then the same is done, but now using values of Z and X in the original model
        
         An important detail of this step is that data for get_functions must be forced 
         to include variables and values of do.
